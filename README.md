NUVU gallery
mission statement

NUVU incorporates augmented reality to create
a new-aged gallery suited to digital artworks that
are being produced with the advancements in
technology, i.e. New Media Arts.
The gallery, NUVU (*New View), will encompass the
augmented reality experience using android tablets,
allowing art that incorporates motion e.g. film, time
lapse, animation, to be displayed on the wall as
traditional artworks with accompanying sound.
NUVU Gallery’s first exhibition will consist of the
theme of surrealism to tribute the transition of
traditional art.
The group members will create all artworks displayed
in the exhibition. The augmented reality application is
developed in house to be customised to the gallery’s
content. NUVU is the evolutionary transition in the art
world, depicting a new element of interpretation and
creation of art with the collaboration of technology.
